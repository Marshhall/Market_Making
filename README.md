# Optimal Market Making and Inventory Management

This repository contains the work developed as part of my **first-year master's thesis** at PSL, under the supervision of Dr. Philippe Bergault (CEREMADE).


## Objectives

The project aims to study and implement **optimal market making models**, with a particular focus on:

- Understanding the trade-off between quote optimization and inventory management
- Applying stochastic control techniques to financial models
- Bridging theoretical results with numerical simulations


## Methodology

The project is structured as follows:

1. **Discrete-Time Market Making**
   - Study of a discrete version of the **Avellaneda-Stoikov model**
   - Control of Markov chains using tools from stochastic processes
   - Analysis of optimal bid and ask quotes as a function of inventory

2. **Extensions**
   - Transition to continuous-time formulations
   - Exploration of model variants (e.g. introducing price signals)

3. **Numerical Implementation**
   - Simulation of optimal strategies
   - Comparison between theoretical results and empirical behavior
